This script is a quick hack that I've used to convert the .schema files
that come with OpenLDAP into proper(?) .ldif files for use with the
'cn=config' configuration setup.  I'm not sure how well it really works
as I'm new to LDAP and have used this on exactly 1 schema file
(duaconf.schema) and all I can say is that so far it seems to work.
