This script is a quick hack that I've used to convert the .schema files that
that come with OpenLDAP into .ldif files for use with the 'cn=config'
configuration setup.

In the schema directory I've included the a number of schema files I've found
around the net to test this script on.

In the ldif directory I've include the converted ldif versions fo the files in
the schema directory.

You will notice that this script does not work on the microsoft* files.  This
is because they include bits that I don't know if OpenLDAP even supports.  Some
day I may figure this out, but for now I am keeping those schema files around
for reference.
